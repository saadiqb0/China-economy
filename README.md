The position and future of [China economy](https://china-economy.org/).

Beijing has once again been at the center of the "new" Afghanistan's security issues, which are more pressing now than they were a few months ago due to an attack by the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) on a hotel in central Kabul housing Chinese guests and businessmen.

Ironically, the ISKP has been filling in the gaps left by the Taliban as it works to transition from an insurgency and terrorist organization to a state and political system vying for international recognition. Pro-ISIS publications that target South Asia, like "Voice of Khorasan," which replaced or absorbed more hyper-local publications like "Sawt Al Hind (Voice of Hind)," have increased their anti-China rhetoric as part of an effort to criticize the Taliban's international reach and the few developing relationships it is attempting to maintain.

While the Taliban spent 20 years portraying the US presence in Afghanistan as an imperialist conquest of their territory and establishing their Islamist ideology around this war against crusaders, much like they did with the former USSR, they now find themselves in conflict with groups like ISKP that view China through a similar prism. Even while Beijing hasn't yet contributed a sizable sum of money to the Taliban's coffers, Beijing is unavoidably regarded via an economic lens rather than the conventional imperial one.
